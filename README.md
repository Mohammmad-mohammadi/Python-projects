## A Message to Future Readers

If you’re looking at this repository years from now, maybe as an employer, a professor, or a curious learner, I want you to know:

This project was created when I was just starting my journey into programming, probability, and data science. Every line of code, every experiment, every README was a step in building the skills and mindset I hope to bring to the world—curiosity, resilience, and a willingness to learn by doing.

If you are evaluating me, please know that I am always growing. I hope this small project shows not only what I could do then, but how much I wanted to understand and improve.

Thank you for looking at my work. I hope to keep making things worth sharing.
